# Surge type glacier data

Code for figures: `surge_data.py`

## data
Here you find the following files:

`00_rgi60_attribs/XX_rgi60_Region.csv`

This is what is currently in RGI60. If you look at surges-RGI60.png (and compare to the other two figures) you will notice that there are quite a 
number of points missing, largely in Alaska. 

`ST_November.csv`

This is the file that Heidi sent me a back in 2021. It contains a similar number of points, but more for Alaska.

`GeodatabaseSTglaciers.csv`

Actually not sure where I got this file. Contains more points, but the spatial pattern is quite similar to what is in the file from Heidi.

## xlsx_docx

Just a collection of the original files.
