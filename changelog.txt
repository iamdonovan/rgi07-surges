    - failed to join:
        - 01 Alaska:
            - two glaciers (Unnamed PA1969 109 and Unnamed PA1969 117) from Post (1969) map. I can't tell which
              glaciers they are meant to be, and both points are very far from the nearest RGI outline.
        - 05 Greenland Periphery:
            - 22 outlet glaciers of GrIS (including some from RGI6 that have been removed from RGI7)
            - one glacier on Disko Island/Qeqertarsuaq: 1HB11009. This is referenced in a book chapter called
              "Surge-type glaciers on Disko Island, Greenland" by Yde and Knudsen, but I cannot find access to it.
        - 06 Iceland:
            - one glacier, Svarfadardalur, which appears to refer to a valley. Point is 3-4 km from nearest glaciers.
        - 13 Asia Central:
            - nine outlines from the RGI6:
                - RGI60-13.12508, 13810, 13899, 14375, 18642, 18736, 20372, 42524, 43252
            - one point that should be in Canada (4*9CBF29), but I can't figure out what happened to the coordinates.
            - ten points from the Karakoram: 14.03.16//69, 14.03.15//11, 14.03.15//80, 14.03.12//10, 14.03.09//437,
                14.03.09//108a, 14.03.08//811, 14.03.08//690, 14.03.08//405, and 14.03.07//239.
                All of these glaciers are referenced in Osipova et al., (1998). Most appear to be included, or are very
                close to glaciers that are included, in the other inventories (Goerlich and HMA).
        - 16 Low Latitudes:
            - row 2202, Ventorillo: glacier no longer exists (RIP). Glacier does appear to exist in 1999/2000
                LE07 imagery, though it's hard to say for sure.


TODO:
	- write script to convert xlsx to csv
	- write script to generate spatialite db
	- add RGI v7 and v6 IDs for each point
    - use a unique key for each glacier (NOT THE NAME)
